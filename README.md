#### dummyProject
This is Foo Bar project implementing Concourse CI 

###### This pipeline uses many parties, there's no why regarding to what i used. As this is not production app. i wanted to do a full deployment for multi components using different approaches that can introduce me to  different possible features in concourse ci while am learning, the pipeline is not for production it is AS is.

#### Technogloies :
 * Local concourse ci where i used the docker version provided by [official documentation] 
 * Docker, and docker-compose for both app and concourese ci
 * golang
 * ansible
 * consoul
 * nginx
